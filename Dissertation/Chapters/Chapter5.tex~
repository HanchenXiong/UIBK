\subsection{3D Point Cloud Registration with Convex Optimization on SO(3) Manifold}
3D shape pose estimation is an essential in computer vision and robot
perception.
Unitl now, the poses of 3D shapes are usually estimated by using registration algorithms. 
Despite intensive study, 3D shape
registration remains an open question. 
For most existing registration algorithms, there are many obstacles to
practical use them in fully autonomous systems. For instance, ICP usually
requires manual assistance to provide a good initialization, and
Gaussian Mixtures and SoftAssign are too expensive for real-time
tasks. Therefore, a novel algorithm developed by the author and other co-workers is to satisfy the
practical need for better robustness and higher efficiency. Quite
different from previous registration methods, instead of computing
correspondence and alignment in 3D space, the propsed algorithm first map
points to a higher, possibly infinite-dimensional space by applying
Kernel methods. Registration is subsequently performed within feature
space by aligning corresponding principal components. The result is
projected back into 3D pose space. The whole procedure is
theoretically elegant and efficient. Kernel PCA is used to avoid
explicit computation in feature space, and SE(3) on-manifold
optimization is employed to enhance the generality of our registration algorithm. 
Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method is quite accurate
and robust to various challenging circumstances (\emph{e.g.} large motion,
presence of outliers), and remarkably, it is much faster than other
state-of-the-art methods with comparable performance.
