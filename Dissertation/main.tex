With the development of modern digitization, increasingly more data emerge in almost all areas. It is worth emphasizing that not only does the quantity 
of the data increase, but also    
the number of data types, or the sources where data are collected, are boosted. 
Undoubtedly, more information can be exploited with the presence of more comprehensive data.        
Nevertheless, merging different data together also makes the analysis of them more challenging.   
There exist various forms of dependencies or interactions among multiple data.  
Therefore, working with these data goes much beyond traditional machine leaning tasks: \emph{e.g.}
classification or regression, where the output is a single scalar.      
In this dissertation, multiple data sets together are considered as structures, in which different dependencies can 
hence be modeled. In particular, structures are encoded within three forms by using: \emph{graphs}, 
\emph{kernels} and \emph{manifolds} respectively,  which can match different application domains.   
This dissertation goes through \emph{inference}, \emph{learning} and \emph{optimization} of structured data which 
are represented with different forms. Some existing work is reviewed while several new methods are put forward.    
In particular, to make the dissertation more practical, different methods were applied and evaluated on real-world application 
domains, including \emph{image segmentation}, \emph{image annotation}, \emph{protein function prediction}, 
\emph{object-action relation modeling} and \emph{3D transformation estimation}. Of course the applicabilities 
of these methods go far beyond those presented in the dissertation. Meanwhile, this dissertation  
attempts to, with practical case studies, provide some main principles or methodologies when confronting structured data, and empirical experience in above-mentioned                 
domains should be easily transferred to other ones.         
Above all, the main contributions of this dissertation are several novel models and learning algorithms for structured outputs, including 
\emph{joint SVM} and \emph{kernel generalized homogeneity analysis} for multi-label learning,  \emph{persistent sequential Monte Carlo} for learning undirected graphical models.  
The study in this dissertation is expected to widen and/or deepen the understanding of relevant research.    \\ 

%\textbf{Keywords:} graphical models, structural output learning, conditional random fields, structural SVM, multivariate analysis, matrix manifolds.

This dissertation is based on my work during years 2011-2015, at the Intelligent and Interactive Systems (IIS) research group, University of Innsbruck.  

First and foremost, I wish to express my sincerest gratitude to my supervisor, Prof. Justus Piater, who has been continuously 
providing me with seasoned guidance while leaving me immense freedom. The dissertation would not have been possible without 
his encouragement and support. My gratitude also goes to Dr. Sandor Szedmak, who is a true workmate and friend to me despite his seniority. I really enjoyed working 
with him and have learnt a lot from him in both scientific knowledge and how to conduct research, which I believe will be of great benefit in my future career. 

I am grateful to all my colleagues, including members who are in IIS now: Emre Ugur,  
Antonio Rogr{\'i}uez-S{\'a}nchez, Philipp Zech, Mirela Popa, {\"O}zg{\"u}r Erkent, Simon Hangl, Sebastian Stabinger, Alexander Rietzler, Dadhichi Shukla, Safoura Rezapour, 
Senka Krivi{\'c}, Raphaela Hauser; and of course also those alumni of IIS: Damien Teney, Heiko Hahn, Thomas Hoyoux, Stephen Cobeldick.    
These fellows accompanied me at different stages of four-year Phd life and brought me plenty of happiness in different ways. In particular, I should thank        
Cornelia Vidovic and Simon Haller, who are always helpful with my trivial things.      

I also would like to acknowledge EU FP7 project, XPERIENCE, from which my Phd study was financially supported. Via the project I also fortunately          
get to know many excellent researchers outside of IIS.  
In particular, I really appreciate Mikkel Tang Thomsen and Wail Mustafa from University of Southern Denmark. They are very good coworkers, actively  
exchanging thoughts with me and motivating me at different lines of research.   

Undoubtedly, there are far more people to whom I own my gratitude. They brought their most wonderful moments to my life, which will be preserved    
in my heart forever. 

I am deeply indebted to my wife, Youlin, who unconditionally stands by me, with patience and encouragement, in all circumstances.          
Last but definitely not least, many thanks to my parents, for everything they have done to me.    \\ \\
